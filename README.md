# 🚀 Project Collection: Study Sync & LeetMetric

This repository contains two separate web development projects built as part of my learning and practice:

1. ✏️ **Study Sync** – a responsive landing page for an educational website  
2. 📊 **LeetMetric** – a mini project with a basic frontend and backend API that shows LeetCode stats by entering a username

Both projects are organized in separate folders in this repository.
